# Project Description

hello thank you for giving me the opportunity

I designed this project using the NextJs framework, hopefully it is friendly for SEO needs and I also designed it using the Atomic Design Pattern
You can see the explanation at this link "https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/" so it is hoped that projects that use patterns will be easy to maintain and reuse, the rest of this project uses standard libraries such as axios, material ui , lazy load, and actually I have designed it for multi theme dark and light theme but I haven't finished it all.

I hope the project that I made can attract your attention so that we can work together in the future

Thank You
